THESIS STATEMENT
We are creating a multicolored 3D rotating cube using the OpenGL ES 2.0 API provided by the GLView library. Several concepts are used, such as the cube geometry, the initialization phase of the model, the adjustment of the model frame by frame, and the way to design the OpenGL ES rendering loop.
METHODOLOGY
o	win: Application window
o	conform: Conformant object for the indicator
o	glview: GLView object
o	main_box: Box object which contains glview and inner_box
o	inner_box: Box object for the toolbox

OBJECTIVES
•	creating a cube,
•	Drawing the cube with GLview,
•	Rendering the cube,
•	Animating the cube,
•	Implementing UI component interaction and implementing effects.

the project is too basic and the TA wants us to add more features to the cube;
therefore, I decided to make the cube look like the teapot in project three,
giving it a new texture and making it like a game where the cube will explode if it is not alligned with a reference, i.e 
for the cube to be alligned it has to be touched an d made to balance with a reference plane due to the calibration of the phone
